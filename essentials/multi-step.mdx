Cortex can automatically decompose complex questions into smaller steps, figure out the best sequence of actions, and return a complete answer. Instead of answering with a single source, it "thinks" through multiple moves to solve multi-part queries.

## Multi-Step Reasoning

**What it is:**  
Cortex can automatically decompose complex questions into smaller steps, figure out the best sequence of actions, and return a complete answer. Instead of answering with a single source, it "thinks" through multiple moves to solve multi-part queries.

**Benefit:**  
Your AI can handle sophisticated workflows, not just simple lookups. This means users can ask bigger questions and get full, intelligent responses that handle context switching, task breakdown, and chaining.

**Use Case & Scenario:**  
A manager asks, "Summarize all Q1 sales calls, extract the action items, and draft a follow-up plan." Instead of returning a paragraph from one call, the AI scans all the calls, builds a structured list of action points, and then writes a plan based on it. This is how you build AI that actually works like a smart assistant.
