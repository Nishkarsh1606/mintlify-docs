Cortex's AI Memories feature lets your application remember what matters. Unlike static knowledge, AI memories are dynamic, user-specific, and continuously updated as users interact with your app. This means your AI can recall preferences, past actions, and contextual signals—enabling truly personalized, adaptive experiences that get smarter with every use.

## What it is
AI memories act as a long-term, evolving profile for each user. They capture not just what users say, but what they mean, their intentions, and their unique behaviors. As users engage with your app, Cortex automatically updates their memory, allowing the AI to learn and adapt over time.

## Benefit
With AI memories, every interaction feels personal. The system tailors responses, anticipates needs, and adapts to changing preferences—driving higher engagement and satisfaction. Your users get an experience that feels like the AI truly "knows" them.

## Use Case & Scenario
Imagine a sales assistant that remembers each rep's preferred answer format and the types of files they use most. Over time, the AI starts responding in the rep's favorite style and prioritizes relevant content, making every interaction faster and more effective. Whether it's remembering a user's favorite data source or adapting to their workflow, AI memories make your app smarter and more helpful with every use.
