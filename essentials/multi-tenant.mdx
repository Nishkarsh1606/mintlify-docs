Cortex lets you create completely isolated workspaces called tenants. Each tenant can represent a client, team, or organization. Inside each tenant, you can also create sub-tenants or user groups. Documents, search results, and memory are isolated per tenant, ensuring clean data separation.

## Multi-Tenant Support

**What it is:**  
Cortex lets you create completely isolated workspaces called tenants. Each tenant can represent a client, team, or organization. Inside each tenant, you can also create sub-tenants or user groups. Documents, search results, and memory are isolated per tenant, ensuring clean data separation.

**Benefit:**  
You can build a secure, scalable B2B platform that serves many organizations at once without cross-contamination of data. It also makes access control, permissions, and context management easier.

**Use Case & Scenario:**  
You're building a knowledge assistant for 10 different consulting firms. Each firm has its own projects, files, and team members. With multi-tenancy, each firm can only access its own data and get search results personalized to its environment, even though the backend is shared.
