## Fine-Tuning Your Retrievals

**What it is:**  
Cortex gives you complete control over how your AI retrieves and ranks results. You can adjust parameters like `recency_bias` to prefer newer documents, or `search_alpha` to balance between exact keyword matches and more flexible semantic understanding. This tuning ensures that your search behavior fits the specific context of your applicationâ€”whether you're building a chatbot, search engine, or intelligent assistant.

**Benefit:**  
You get more accurate, relevant, and high-quality results every time. Users won't be shown outdated or irrelevant information. Instead, they receive answers that match both what they *say* and what they *mean*. This builds trust and improves task success.

**Use Case & Scenario:**  
Imagine you're building a support chatbot for a SaaS product. A user asks, "Why was my payment declined?" Instead of retrieving every document with the word "payment," the bot prioritizes recent tickets that semantically match issues related to failed billing. The user gets an instant, relevant response without sifting through old or off-topic results.
